        "If a number is even or a number whose last digit is an even number i.e.  2,4,6,8 including 0, it is always completely divisible by 2.\n",

        "Example: 508 is an even number and is divisible by 2 but 509 is not an even number, hence it is not divisible by 2. Procedure to check whether 508 is divisible by 2 or not is as follows:\n",

If the sum is a multiple of 3, then the original number is also divisible by 3. Here, since 11 is not divisible by 3, 308 is also not divisible by 3.\n",

            "2. **Subtract from the Rest:** Remove the last digit from the original number and subtract the doubled value you just calculated. \n",
            "3. **Repeat (If Necessary):**  If the result is still too large to determine divisibility by 7 easily, repeat steps 1 and 2 with the new number.\n",
            "4. **Check for Divisibility:**  Continue this process until you arrive at a number that you can easily tell is either divisible by 7 or not. If the final result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7.\n",
